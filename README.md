# Ruby Koans Refresher

A TDD learning approach to Ruby via [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/).

## Setup

All you will need is Ruby. To see if you have Ruby you can run: `which ruby` on Unix based systems. You can verify the version you're running with: `ruby -v`.

## Running

```shell
ruby path_to_enlightenment.rb
```

## Tips & Tricks

You can use a simple watcher called rerun if you want it to run the tests on changes.

```shell
gem install rerun
rerun ruby path_to_enlightenment.rb
```

## More Information

I spun this repo up using the zip provided on the Koans website, but there's a more modern approach here: https://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans which goes into greater detail.
